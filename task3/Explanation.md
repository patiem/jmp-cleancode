Upon reviewing the provided code, I noticed a potential LSP violation in the PayPalPayment class. 
The method processPayment in PayPalPayment raises an UnsupportedOperationException 
if a PayPal account is not linked to a bank account, which is not expected behavior
based on the superclass PaymentMethod. This divergence in behavior when substituting 
PaymentMethod with PayPalPayment could lead to runtime errors if not properly handled.

One method to ensure compliance with the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in object-oriented design 
is by leveraging the Decorator Pattern. This pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects,
either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
This can be particularly useful in cases where only certain instances of a subclass need 
to modify their behavior compared to the superclass, thus maintaining LSP compliance by not altering 
the fundamental behavior of the subclass itself.

Implementing Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern can be particularly useful in a payment processing system 
where different payment methods might require additional steps or checks under certain conditions 
without changing the core functionality provided by the superclass.

Explanation:
Decorator Base Class: The PaymentDecorator class extends PaymentMethod and holds a reference
to a PaymentMethod object. It delegates calls to the object it decorates, adding new functionality
before or after forwarding the request.

Concrete Decorator: BankAccountLinkedCheckDecorator adds extra validation step to ensure
a bank account is linked. This is only used with PayPalPayment if necessary, without modifying
the PayPalPayment class itself.

Maintaining LSP Compliance: By using decorators, the original PaymentMethod subclasses
(like CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment) do not need to change their behavior.
Decorators enhance functionality dynamically at runtime, ensuring that any subclass of PaymentMethod
can still be replaced with another without breaking the program.

Benefits:
Flexibility: Decorators provide a flexible way to add responsibilities to objects
without modifying their existing classes.
Scalability: New functionality can be introduced without disturbing existing code structure,
making maintenance easier.
